# Q-learning-using-Open-AI-mountain-car
#### 1)Install Anaconda 3 and get Open AI Gym from:

            pip install gym
            
            
#### 2) From Anaconda Prompt/Terminal do: 

            python mountainbaseline.py                      for baseline model
            
            python mountainq.py                             for Q function implemented code with hyperparameters
#### 3) The graphs are representative of scores with episode and epsilon decay with episodes for each game specified by hyperparameters specified in title of the graph where:
            alpha= Learning Rate
            gamma= discount factor
            epsilon= exploration policy factor
            maxQ= is update policy of Q table argmax for Q values or not

#### 4) values.txt has command line output of all runs for over 9 hours of running
#### 5) Solutions.txt has understandings,  abstract ,inference, MIT Licence, References
